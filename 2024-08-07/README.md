# Java Programming Questions [07 August 2024]

## Problem 1

Write a program in Java to create a class `Student` with data members `name`, `city`, and `age`. Include the following
methods:

- `setData()`: Method to set the values of the data members.
- `printData()`: Method to display the data.

---

## Problem 2

Define a `Student` class with the following data members:

- `roll`: integer
- `number`: string
- `marks`: float

Include the following methods:

- Parameterized setter method to set the student data members.
- `display()`: Method to print student details.

Instantiate a `Student` object using the parameterized setter method and use the `display()` method to print the details
of the student.

## Problem 3

Write a program in Java to create a class `Animal` having a method `eat()` that prints the message "All animals can
eat". Create a child class `Dog` from the `Animal` class. The `Dog` class should have its own member method called
`bark()` that prints the message "Dogs are barking". Instantiate an object of `Dog` to print its eating and barking
nature.

## Problem 4

Write a program to design a class `AreaCalculation` and calculate the area using method overloading for the following
shapes:

- Circle with a radius of 7 cm.
- Rectangle with a length of 4.5 cm and breadth of 4 cm.
- Cuboid with a length of 3 cm, breadth of 2 cm, and height of 4 cm.

---

## Problem 5

Define a `Student` class with the following data members:

- `roll`: integer
- `number`: string
- `marks`: float

Include the following methods:

- No-argument getter method to initialize the student object.
- Parameterized getter method to initialize the student object.
- `display()`: Method to print the contents of the student object.

Create two `Student` objects:

1. One object is initialized using the parameterized getter method.
2. The second object is initialized using the no-argument getter method.

Use the `display()` method to print the contents of each object. (Use method overloading)
